              Susan Cain: Introvert Pow!er




                               In	an	increasingly	social	world,	Susan	Cain	shifts	our	focus	to	help	us	reconsider
                               the	role	of	introverts	—	outlining	their	many	strengths	and	vital	contributions.
                               Like	A Whole New Mind and	Stumbling on Happinuess,	Cain’s	book,	Quiet: The
                               Power of Introverts uIn a World That Can’t Stop Talkinggm-changing
                               lodestar	that	shows	how	dramatically	our	culture	has	come	to	misunderstand
                               and	undervalue	introverts.	You	would	think	Cain,	a	Princeton	and	Harvard	Law
                               School-educated	author,	would	be	your	typical,	self-confident,	pound-the-table
                               kind	of	person;	in	fact,	she’s	just	the	opposite.	She’d	rather	read	than	socialize,
                               and	she	thinks	before	she	speaks	(softly).	But	far	from	considering	these	disad-
                               vantageous	traits,	Cain	owes	her	success	to	them.

                               Cain	has	practiced	corporate	law	for	seven	years,	representing	clients	like
                              fund	managers	to	TV	producers	to	college	grads	navigating	their	first	jobs.	Cain
        has	used	her	time	in	corporate	boardrooms,	together	with	her	experience	as	both	a	student	and	teacher	of
        negotiation,	to	create	uniquely	informative	talks.
