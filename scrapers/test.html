                                <span itemprop="description"><p>Libraries are challenged to communicate their value in uncertain fiscal and changing environments. Our communities, boards, management, and institutions are asking for stronger and better measurements of our impact and value to help them with decision-making and prioritization. This interactive, half-day workshop looks at the various metrics and measures the library sector uses to manage what it is doing (its activities and individual services) and the value of what it is doing. These are very different measurement objectives and processes, yet complementary and vital. It discusses &ldquo;measurement&rdquo; in a broad sense, including the value of selected services, as well as the overall management of processes and services. It is very important that people in the library sector are aware of different measures&mdash;with different objectives. Who knows where new ideas will come from? All libraries can learn from each other.</p></span>
